# IA_Project7_Openclassrooms_IA_SentimentAnalysis
Sentiment Analysis of Tweets, for AirParadis (Educational project)

## Air Paradis

Repository of OpenClassrooms project 7' [AI Engineer path](https://openclassrooms.com/fr/paths/188)

Goal : "Air Paradis" is an airline company who's marketing department wants to be able to detect quickly "bad buzz" on social networks, to be able to anticipate and address issues as fast as possible. They need an AI API that can detect "bad buzz" and predict the reason for it.
The goal here is to evaluate different approaches to detect "bad buzz"
